				<h2>Lesson 1</h2>
				<span class="byline">Data Types, Variables and If Statements</span> 
			</div>
				<p>	The main function of any computer program is to collect, store and process data in one way or another. Therefore before learning anything else, we need to understand what Data Types and Variables are, as these are key to knowing how to process data. </p>

				<h3>Data Types</h3><br>

				<p>"Data Types" is a term used to refer to the different forms of data that exist in a program. For instance, numbers such as 5 or 500 are called Integers (or Int for short), whereas letters or a group of letters such as “f” or “five” are known as a String.

				We need to specify what type of data we are using in a program because these various types of data take up different amounts of memory, also, certain operations can only be performed on some of these types. For instance we cannot divide 5 by the String “hello”.

				<br><br>Here is a full list of the different data types available in Haxe:</p>

				<li><i>String</i> - A letter or group of letters. E.g. “f” or “five” </li><br>
				<li><i>Integer</i> - Numbers such as 5 or 500, or even hexadecimal numbers like 0xFA.</li><br>
				<li><i>Float</i> - Decimal point numbers such at 1.5 or 100.523. Scientific notation can be used here as well. e.g. 2e4 (2 x 10^4)</li><br>
				<li><i>Boolean</i> - A type that can only be one of two values, true or false.</li><br>
				<li><i>Dynamic</i> - This data type can be any type, and can even change types during the course of a program.</li><br>
				<li><i>Unknown</i> - A data type that we have not yet set. This gets set automatically once you give it some data.</li><br>
				<li><i>Void</i> - A way to represent no type, for example when there is no data.</li><br>

				<br>
				<h3>Variables</h3><br>

				<p>In any program, variables are the containers for the data that we use. These variables are given a name so that we can keep track of them easily. No two variables can have the same name.

				When we want to create a variable to contain our data, we “declare” the variable by giving it a name and the type of data that it will contain. This is known as “Declaration”.</p>


				<h4>Example</h4>

				<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-haxe">var shipName:String = “Galactica”;</code></pre>

				<p>In this example we use the <code>var</code> keyword to indicate that we are going to declare a variable. <code>shipName</code> is the name we are giving to this variable, and <code>String</code> is the type of data that can be contained within it. We also initialise the variable by giving it some data straight away. In this case our ship is called the <code>“Galactica”</code>. 

				<br>If we wanted to rename our ship later in the program we can do this by simply writing the following line:</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-haxe">shipName = “Colonial One”;</code></pre>				

				<p>Notice we do not need to use the keyword <code>var</code> or specify a type again as we have already declared the variable and given it name which we can use to refer to it later in the program.</p>

				<br><br>	

				<h3>If Statements</h3><br>

				<p> 
				One of the most useful tools we have as programmers are known as If Statements. <br>
				If statements are used when we only want lines of code to be executed if a condition is met. For example, we would only want the game over screen to appear if the player has reacher 0 hit points. <br>
				Here is how that would look like in Haxe: <br>
				<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-haxe">if (health <= 0){<br>    gameOver(); <br>}</code></pre>

				<p>In this case we use the keyword <code>if</code> followed by a condition thats surrounded by round brackets <code>(  )</code>.<br>
				We then put all the code we want to execute if the condition is true, after the condition surrounded by curly brackets <code>{  }</code>.<br><br>

				But what do we do if the condition is not true?<br>

				This is where we use the <code>else</code> keyword. This will execute the code after the <code>else</code> keyword if the original <code>if</code> condition is not met.<br>
				
				<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-haxe">if (health <= 0){<br>    gameOver(); <br>}<br>else{<br>    keepPlaying();<br>}</code></pre><br>

				We can also have multiple if statements in a row in case we need to set multiple conditions.	

				<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-haxe">if (health <= 0){<br>    gameOver(); <br>}<br>else if (health < 10){<br>    flashScreen();<br>    keepPlaying();<br>}</code></pre><br>

				In this case the program checks the first condition, if that is not met then it moves on to the next condition, and so on.<br><br>

				</p>
				</p>

				<h2>Exercise 1</h2><br>

				<p>Now lets put what we've learned to use in our game.<br><br>

				To start, open the file <code>Player.hx</code> in your favourite text editor. <br>
				Then go to line 31. This section of code is going to deal with our ships movement. <br><br>

				What we want to do here is to allow our ship to move if we press certain keys. For instance, if we press the up arrow key, the ship should move upwards.<br>
				In order to achieve this, we need two variables called   <code>move_x</code>  and  <code>move_y</code>.<br>
				These will store the integer values that make our ship move along the x or y axis of the screen.<br><br>

				Then we need to determine if a player is pressing the keys we want them to press.<br>
				To do this we use the function 
				<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-haxe">Framework.input.keydown(n)</code></pre>
				<p>
				Where <code>n</code> is a number representing a key.<br>
				Do some googling to figure out which numbers correspond to the keys you want to use.<br><br>

				Finally, use your knowledge of If Statements to make the ship move left, right, up and down if the player presses the right keys. <br><br>

				<i>Hint: You may need two sets of If Statements. One for left and right movements and the other for up and down movements.</i>
