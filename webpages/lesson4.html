				<h2>Lesson 4</h2>
				<span class="byline">Vectors, velocity, player movement and homing missiles.</span> 
			</div>
			<p>So far, we've made the player move around based on keyboard input. Let's take a closer look at how movement is represented in the game, and how the homing missile object follows the player.</p>
			
			<h3>Vectors</h3><br />
			<p>A vector is a quantity which has magnitude and direction (as opposed to scalars, which only have magnitude). For example, the distance between two locations is a scalar; but the <i>displacement</i> of one location from another i.e. the distance in a certain direction, is a vector.</p>
			<p>In this game, vectors are expressed in the Cartesian coordinate system, having an x-component, which represents distance along the horizontal axis; and y-component, which represents distance along the vertical axis. Entities' boxes are moved by adding a vector to their <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> variables, which together represent its position on the plane. Adding of vectors is done component-wise. A vector's length can also be adjusted by multiplying it by a value. Look in the <code>Vector</code> class for the operations on vectors used in this game.</p>
			<p>You may have noticed that when moving diagonally, the player object moves faster than when moving only in the horizontal or vertical axes. This is because when two keys are pressed, the player's position is added to by two vectors instead of one. To overcome this, we need to "normalize" the diagonal vector that is created when adding the horizontal and vertical vectors, that is to say, change its length to one so that the player moves at the same rate when moving diagonally.</p>
			<p>The class <code>Vector</code> has a property named <code>length</code>. We can set this to change the distance which the player moves each time its state is updated. Consider the equation: <p><i>speed = distance/time</i>, and following from that <p><i>distance = speed x time</i></p>
			<p>The time taken in this case is the time between each frame. Looking at the function <code>update</code> in the <code>Player</code> class, the reason for passing the variable <code>dt</code> becomes apparent: in order to calculate the distance that the player <i>should</i> move, we need the time between each frame. </p>
			<h3>Homing missiles</h3><br />
			<p>The homing missile is a projectile that constantly follows the player. To achieve this, we need to be able to constantly speed it in a direction towards the player object. This is possible by finding the difference in the player's position and the missile's position, and then adding velocity to the missile in this direction. The difference in the player's position and missile's position can be expressed as a vector, so we can add this vector to the <code>velocity: Vector</code> property of the missile. <code>Missile</code> also has the two properties <code>speed: Float</code> and <code>steering_impulse: Float</code>. <code>speed</code> is meant to be the max speed of the missile, and <code>steering_impulse</code> could control the length of the vector to add to the missile's velocity, in order to adjust the rate of homing.</p>




			<h2>Exercise 4</h2><br />
			<p>In the file <code>Player.hx</code>, find the code that moves the player, which looks like this: 
			<pre class=prettyprint><code class=language-haxe>rect.move(move.x, move.y);</code></pre>
			Above it, insert code that sets the <code>length</code> property of the <code>Vector move</code> to the appropriate value based on the player's speed and the time between each frame, to make sure that diagonal movements are at the same speed.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>In the file <code>Missile.hx</code>, implement code which makes the missile follow the player.
