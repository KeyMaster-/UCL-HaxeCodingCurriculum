				<h2>Lesson 4</h2>
				<span class="byline">Vectors, velocity, player movement and homing missiles.</span> 
			</div>
			<p>So far, we've made the player move around based on keyboard input. Let's take a closer look at how movement is represented in the game, and how the homing missile object follows the player.</p>
			
			<h3>Vectors</h3><br />
			<p>A vector is a quantity which has magnitude and direction (as opposed to scalars, which only have magnitude). For example, the distance between two locations is a scalar; but the <i>displacement</i> of one location from another i.e. the distance in a certain direction, is a vector. A vector is perhaps best visualised by an arrow pointing in the direction of the vector with length depending on the magnitude.</p>
			<p>In this game, vectors are expressed in the Cartesian coordinate system, having an x-component, which represents distance along the horizontal axis; and y-component, which represents distance along the vertical axis. Entities' boxes are moved by adding a vector to their <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> variables, which together represent its position on the plane. Adding vectors can be thought of as chaining the arrows which represent the vectors together, but an easier way is to add them component-wise, i.e. splitting the vectors to be added into x and y components, and adding those seperately to get the resultant vector. A vector's length can also be adjusted by multiplying it by a scalar. Look in the <code>Vector</code> class for the operations on vectors used in this game.</p>
			<p>You may have noticed that when moving diagonally, the player object moves faster than when moving only in the horizontal or vertical axes. This is because when two keys are pressed, the player's position is added to by two vectors instead of one. To overcome this, we need to "normalize" the diagonal vector that is created when adding the horizontal and vertical vectors, that is to say, change its length to one so that the player moves at the same rate when moving diagonally.</p>
			<p>The class <code>Vector</code> has a property named <code>length</code>. We can set this to change the distance which the player moves each time its state is updated. Consider the equation: <p><i>speed = distance/time</i>, and following from that <p><i>distance = speed x time</i></p>
			<p>The time taken in this case is the time between each frame. Looking at the function <code>update</code> in the <code>Player</code> class, the reason for passing the variable <code>dt</code> becomes apparent: in order to calculate the distance that the player <i>should</i> move, we need the time between each frame. </p>
			<h3>Homing missiles</h3><br />
			<p>The homing missile is a projectile that constantly follows the player. To achieve this, we need to be able to constantly speed it in a direction towards the player object. To do this, first we should implement the empty function body <code>update</code> inside <code>Missile.hx</code>. The missile should have a <code>velocity: Vector</code> property, and be displaced by <code>velocity*dt</code> each time the update function is called. This should be done by using <code>rect.move()</code> (i.e. calling the <code>move()</code> function on the inherited <code>rect</code>), making sure that the appropriate parameters are used. Before making the missile home in on the player, try making the missile move with a constant velocity.</p>
			<p>Making the missile home in on the player is possible by finding the difference in the player's position and the missile's position, and then adding velocity to the missile in this direction. The player's position and the missile's position are both vectors, and the difference in the player's position and missile's position can itself be expressed as a vector, so we can add this vector to a <code>velocity: Vector</code> property of the missile in order to accelerate the missile towards the player object. Since constantly adding velocity to the missile will cause it to move faster and faster until eventually it is unavoidable by the player, we also need to set a maximum speed for the missile. Consider adding a <code>max_speed</code> property to the missile class, and using an <code>if</code>-statement to ensure that the missile doesn't exceed this speed. Also, you may want to make the missile accelerate towards the player at a faster rate. To do this, multiply the difference vector by a scalar - it may have to be quite a large number for the acceleration to be noticeable.</p>




			<h2>Exercise 4</h2><br />
			<p>In the file <code>Player.hx</code>, find the code that moves the player. Modify this to use a vector and <code>rect.move(x, y)</code> instead of directly adding to the player's position with each keypress. More explicitly, this can be achieved by declaring a new vector, modifying the vector's <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties based on keypresses, then adjusting the vector's length to the appropriate value, and finally moving the rectangle using the vector.</p>
			<br />
			<p>In the file <code>Missile.hx</code>, implement code which makes the missile follow the player.
